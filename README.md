## How to use:
1. Add the bot to your Discord server.
2. Give all the Furries in your server a role called `Furry`
3. Watch as it create chaos amongst the furries.

**TIP:**: If the furries are somehow removeing their roles, simply add their Discord ID to the `furryID` array (For this you obviously need to host the bot yourself).

**ABUSE**: If the furries for some reason don't find this off putting enough, add their Discord ID to the `abuseID` array (For this you obviously need to host the bot yourself). Adding their ID's will make the bot encrypt their messages, making them imposible to read. NOTE: This feature can't be added by using an `Abuse` role because that would give the furries a chance of removing it.
